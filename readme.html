<p>A fun interactive way to view a player champion mastery as a card collection spread out on a table.</p>

<p>Master Champions in League of Legends and earn their cards! If you manage to reach mastery level 4 you&#8217;ll earn their <strong>&#8216;basic&#8217;</strong> card. Grind out mastery level 5 and earn yourself an S on that champion and a <strong>rare</strong> version of the card will be added to your collection!</p>
