#Hexdeck Collection
A fun interactive way to view a player champion mastery as a card collection spread out on a table.

Master Champions in League of Legends and earn their cards! If you manage to reach mastery level 4 you'll earn their **'basic'** card. Grind out mastery level 5 and earn yourself an S on that champion and a **rare** version of the card will be added to your collection!

Drag, drop, and organize to your heart's content. Can you collect 10 rares?
