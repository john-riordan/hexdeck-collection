#Hextech Trasure Map
'Hextech Trasure Map' is fun interactive tool for mapping out what champions you should play to maximize your chances of earning a Hextech Chest.

## How suggestions are made
There are 3 key factors that are taken into account when determining what champion to suggest.
1. Have you already earned a chest on a champion? If so, that champion will not be suggested.
2. Are you experienced on the champion (high mastery score)?
3. Are you good with the champion (champion mastery/games played)?
4. What is that champions current strength (champion.gg global winrate)?
5. Does the champion fit into your 'position' (ex. support)?
